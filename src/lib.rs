//! Poll stream partially and get emitted items back!

//! Sometimes it is useful to let someone poll you stream but be able to get it back as if it was never polled.
//! To do so, this crate provides function `split`, that, given stream, returns tuple of future and stream.
//! You can move returned stream to any function, losing it, but, when it gets dropped,
//! future, returned from `split`, is resolved with new stream that provides all items that was consumed from
//! original stream, as well as the rest of this stream, so you can use it as if you never poll original stream.

//! Note: Rust doesn't guarantee that Drop is ever called, so you may need to use timeout when you await returned future,
//! otherwise you will wait for it's resolve forever!
